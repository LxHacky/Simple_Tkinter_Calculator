# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Tkinter GUI)

A beginner-friendly **GUI Calculator** built using **Python and Tkinter**, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations with proper error handling.

---
## 📌 Basic Details

This is an individual project created purely for learning and practice purposes.  
The main goal was to understand GUI development, event handling, and error management using Python and Tkinter.

## 🧠 Project Description

This project is a **desktop-based calculator application** developed using "Python’s Tkinter library".  
It provides a clean graphical interface for performing arithmetic operations **without using `eval()`**, ensuring better understanding of core programming logic.

---

## ❓ The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

Using mobile or system calculators doesn’t help beginners understand **how calculations actually work in code**.

---

## 💡 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

A simple GUI calculator that demonstrates:
- Button handling
- User input processing
- Conditional logic
- Error handling  
—all in a beginner-friendly way.
